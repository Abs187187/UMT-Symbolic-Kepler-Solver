# UMT-Symbolic-Kepler-Solver

Open-source implementation of the Unified Mathematical Taxonomy (UMT) symbolic and hyperbolic Kepler solvers with datasets and benchmarks.

## Description

This repository provides a comprehensive symbolic and hyperbolic solver based on the Unified Mathematical Taxonomy (UMT) framework. The solvers are designed to solve Kepler’s Equation for both elliptical and hyperbolic orbits, using deterministic, projection-based methods. These solvers are highly transparent, do not require iterative methods, and have been benchmarked with real-world datasets for various celestial bodies.

### Key Features:
- **UMT-based approach**: Symbolic solutions for elliptical and hyperbolic orbits.
- **Datasets**: Includes datasets for planets, moons, comets, and interstellar visitors.
- **Benchmarking**: Performance comparison against classic methods (Newton-Raphson).
- **High precision**: Suitable for use in modern astronomy and interstellar studies.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Abs187187/UMT-Symbolic-Kepler-Solver.git

### 2. **Install Dependencies**:
This project requires Python 3.7+ along with the following packages:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
Install dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. **Run the Solver**:
You can run the solver with a simple Python script:
```bash
python umt_solver.py
Datasets
The datasets included in this repository are from the JPL Horizons database, with additional real-time datasets provided by Nick James via the Find_Orb software for recent interstellar visitors like A11pl3Z.

Planets and Moons: Datasets from the JPL Horizons database.

Interstellar Visitors: Data for 1I/Oumuamua, C/2021 Borisov, and A11pl3Z (31-ATLAS).

Other Bodies: Includes Halley’s Comet and others.

Batch Processing and Benchmarking
A Jupyter Notebook is available for batch processing and benchmarking. This will allow you to run the solver step by step and compare performance across different datasets. (Coming soon!)
