# UMT Five Pillars Diagnostic Toolkit

## Purpose

This project aims to build a plug-and-play diagnostic toolkit based on the Unified Mathematical Taxonomy (UMT) “Five Pillars”:  
- Projection Logic  
- Structural Operator Dynamics  
- Entropy Information Convergence  
- Subspace Relation Encoding  
- Canonical Equilibrium Constraints  

Each pillar is implemented as a software module that tests mathematical models, systems of equations, or datasets for deep structural integrity—catching not just simple errors, but foundational problems: lost information, broken invariants, improper mappings, or mis-encoded relations.

## Motivation

Most scientific, engineering, and AI models today are “black boxes.” The UMT toolkit provides an open, transparent, and modular approach to diagnose where models fail at a foundational mathematical level, offering insights that are domain-independent and mathematically rigorous.

## Target Users

- Researchers and engineers building or testing physical, biological, computational, or AI models.
- Anyone who wants to “stress-test” the structural soundness of their equations or code using the UMT framework.

## Value Proposition

- Rapid, automated, and modular diagnostics for model integrity.
- No more “mystery bugs” due to structural misalignment.
- Completely open-source, traceable, and extendable for any discipline.

**First prototype will focus on the Projection Logic module, before expanding to all Five Pillars.**
